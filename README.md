# NetSec-PA1-18045107
DES implementation in python with varying hyperparameters to demonstrate avalanche effect and also see the effect of weak keys.


This is a rough implementation as you can see from the screenshots from the report. I will upload a better code soon, in a new branchh soon!

Since the project is on django, to run on browser you need to 
1. Activate the virtual environment - myenv 
2. Change directory to the pa1 directory
3. Run python manage.py runserver.
